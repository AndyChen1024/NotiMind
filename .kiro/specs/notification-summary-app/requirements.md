# Requirements Document

## Introduction

NotiMind (知汇) is an Android application designed to collect, analyze, and summarize system notifications using AI. The app provides users with categorized summaries of their notifications (news, personal messages, service updates, promotions, etc.) in both time-based and app-based views. This helps users manage information overload by presenting their notification data in an organized, digestible format.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Notification Collection System

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to collect my Android system notifications in the background, so that I can later review them without having to check each notification in real-time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app is installed and permissions are granted THEN the system SHALL start collecting notifications in the background
2. WHEN a notification arrives on the device THEN the system SHALL capture and store its content, source app, and timestamp
3. WHEN the app is running in the background THEN the system SHALL continue to collect notifications without user intervention
4. IF a notification contains sensitive content THEN the system SHALL store it securely
5. WHEN the notification collection service is interrupted THEN the system SHALL attempt to restart automatically
6. IF the user revokes notification access permission THEN the system SHALL stop collection and notify the user

### Requirement 2: Notification Storage and Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want my collected notifications to be stored locally on my device, so that my data remains private and accessible even without an internet connection.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a notification is collected THEN the system SHALL store it in a local Room database
2. WHEN storing notifications THEN the system SHALL include metadata such as app name, notification time, and content
3. WHEN the database grows beyond a reasonable size THEN the system SHALL implement data retention policies to manage storage
4. WHEN the user requests to clear data THEN the system SHALL provide options for selective or complete data removal
5. IF the user wants to export their data THEN the system SHALL provide an export functionality
6. WHEN notifications are stored THEN the system SHALL organize them in a way that facilitates efficient retrieval for analysis

### Requirement 3: AI-Powered Notification Analysis

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to analyze my notifications using AI, so that I can understand patterns and get meaningful summaries of my notification content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sufficient notifications are collected THEN the system SHALL analyze them periodically
2. WHEN analyzing notifications THEN the system SHALL categorize them into meaningful groups (news, messages, promotions, etc.)
3. WHEN categorizing notifications THEN the system SHALL consider the source app, content, and timing
4. IF the AI analysis cannot be performed due to technical limitations THEN the system SHALL fall back to basic categorization
5. WHEN analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL generate human-readable summaries
6. WHEN generating summaries THEN the system SHALL prioritize important information

### Requirement 4: Time-Based Summary View

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view notification summaries organized by time periods, so that I can understand what I missed during specific parts of the day.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the summary screen THEN the system SHALL display summaries organized by time periods (morning, afternoon, evening)
2. WHEN displaying time-based summaries THEN the system SHALL show clear time period labels
3. WHEN the user selects a time period THEN the system SHALL display detailed summaries for that period
4. WHEN showing time-based summaries THEN the system SHALL include notification counts and category distributions
5. IF there are no notifications for a time period THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate empty state
6. WHEN displaying summaries THEN the system SHALL allow navigation between different days

### Requirement 5: App-Based Summary View

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view notification summaries organized by application, so that I can understand which apps are sending me the most notifications and what they contain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user switches to app-based view THEN the system SHALL display summaries organized by source application
2. WHEN displaying app-based summaries THEN the system SHALL show app icons for easy identification
3. WHEN the user selects an app THEN the system SHALL display detailed notification summaries for that app
4. WHEN showing app-based summaries THEN the system SHALL include notification counts and timing information
5. IF there are no notifications for an app THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate empty state
6. WHEN displaying app summaries THEN the system SHALL allow filtering by time period

### Requirement 6: Permission Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want a clear and simple way to grant the necessary permissions for notification access, so that I can easily set up the app without confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user first launches the app THEN the system SHALL guide them through the permission request process
2. WHEN requesting notification access THEN the system SHALL explain why this permission is needed
3. IF the user denies permission THEN the system SHALL provide clear instructions on how to enable it later
4. WHEN permissions are granted THEN the system SHALL immediately activate notification collection
5. IF the system detects that permissions have been revoked THEN the system SHALL prompt the user to restore them
6. WHEN displaying permission requests THEN the system SHALL use clear, non-technical language

### Requirement 7: Settings and Customization

**User Story:** As a user, I want to customize the app's behavior and appearance, so that it better fits my personal preferences and needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses settings THEN the system SHALL provide options to customize the app
2. WHEN in settings THEN the system SHALL allow users to toggle between summary styles
3. WHEN in settings THEN the system SHALL provide data management options (clear, export)
4. WHEN the user changes a setting THEN the system SHALL apply changes immediately
5. WHEN the system theme changes THEN the app SHALL adapt to light/dark mode accordingly
6. IF the user wants to disable certain features THEN the system SHALL respect these preferences

### Requirement 8: User Interface and Experience

**User Story:** As a user, I want an intuitive, modern interface following Material 3 design principles, so that the app is pleasant to use and easy to navigate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app is launched THEN the system SHALL present a clean, Material 3 compliant interface
2. WHEN navigating the app THEN the system SHALL provide smooth transitions between screens
3. WHEN displaying content THEN the system SHALL adapt to different screen sizes and orientations
4. WHEN the user interacts with elements THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate feedback
5. IF the device supports dynamic theming THEN the system SHALL implement Material You theming
6. WHEN displaying text and content THEN the system SHALL ensure accessibility standards are met
